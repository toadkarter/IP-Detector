# IP-Detector
A Bash script to show IP addresses currently online on your network. IP Detector uses a simple ping command to check every address on your network, and will output the name of the address if it gets a hit. 

## Using IP Detector
To use, just call the script with the name of your network address as the parameter. For example: 

    ./ipdetector.sh XXX.XXX.X

In the above example, the parameter XXX.XXX.X corresponds to the network address you are currently on.
